        <p>Prologue</p>
        <p><small>The year is 2020. Most great thinkers of earth had sensed struggle and unrest brewing for quite some time, 
          but very few were prepared for what was to come next. Sickness, suffering, and death were just the tip of the iceberg
           as an already unstable human race was ravaged by plague, cultural divergence, and warfare. 
           <br/>

           The following is a collection of diary entries, news articles, letters, and other miscellaneous artifacts 
           from one group of completely insignificant boys who had been forced to stay in their homes and play video games during this 
           unprecedented year.</small>

      <p className="diary">
      The unrest among the group has lead to a few seemingly harmless battles to air some petty grievances. Tonight my battle strategy was sound, but the execution was poor. We had built up a huge border defense on the southern region during the Battle of Caso-Johnson, but left an unfortunate gap when I sent a western army, fully armed, up through Canada. 
      Devistatingly, I ran outta time just as I was hitting the fortify button. That small opening was all General Johnson's army needed to make its move. 
      Bruised, but not defeated from the bloody Caso-Johnson war, General Johnson sent his men down through the gap and wreaked havoc on the southern region. 
      The fight continued in Canada but it was not enough to take down the almighty Johnson. With a damaged south and a once cololorful map 
      now only scattered with red, General Johnson was able to return north and claim victory once again.

      The battle is over, but the scars remain.</p>

      Throughout the ceasefire, the politicians continued to bicker from high atop their castle walls, unable 
      to reach an agreement.

      Before too long, another armistice had been broken. The calls for peace had been silenced.

<h3>G. Johnson Falls Hard</h3>

The ceasefire proved costly for General Johnson’s troops, 
as the undefeated veteran collapsed to two previously 
winless armies in yet another bloody Saturday night. 
General Dowals, new on the scene of war, quickly rose 
through the ranks after wiping Deutschland clean of the

      Alternating between peace and war seems to be the new normal. It's unclear how long this will last, however it doesn't
       seem to be ending any time soon. Most of the other leaders seem reasonable, so perhaps we can come to some sort of agreement. The only one 
       I'm truly nervous about is the Jr. Lieutenant. He seems too inexperienced to be dealing with this caliber of war. Someone should keep an eye on him.

    <h3>The Worth of War</h3>
  <h4>May 10, 2020</h4>
  </p>
<p className="news">
 The eerie silence of the DMZ was eagerly shattered as Ol General Patch spiked his fancy wine-beer, 
  loudly declaring warfare across Europe. The destruction continued with the Almighty Johnson 
  demolishing France for the first victory of the evening. In the battle that followed the Green army was swiftly cast to the 
  southwest corner, relying on carefully executed alliances and manipulative 
  lawyer-speak just to survive. Also fighting in the south, the piss-colored Yellow army was prematurely 
  destroyed in both battles, leaving General Daddison with a fading taste of victory and an army 
  hungry for vengeance. As tensions grew late into the hours of darkness, General Dowals broke 
  a strong alliance with General Patch and began his valiant march through the north, only to be stopped 
  devastatingly short at just 67% of the map. The failed climatic offensive left the door open for General Kev and his Red army to 
  bleed across the north, claiming the final victory of the night from his tiny camp on Randall’s island.

  <i>“In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers”</i>, Jr. Lieutenant 'the' 
  Caso tells himself as he contemplates his failed alliance strategies. The Junior Lieutenant looks over his 
  Blue army, now appearing purple from the blood soaked uniforms, and quietly tells them to go home and “thank 
  your mothahs”.

<h3>Jr. L. 'T.' Caso Gets Questionable Win</h3>
<h4>May 17, 2020</h4>
</p>
<p className="news">
  Junior Lieutenant ‘the’ Caso claimed his first victory of the war last night, although rumors of chemical 
    warfare could prove diminishing to the win. “I felt loopy, I certainly wasn’t myself,” General Rad stated to 
    reporters when asked why he didn’t use his cards at a crucial battle moment. “I guess it coulda been the anchovies,” 
    he added, apprehensively. In response to the allegations, Lieutenant the Caso began to describe an awkward dream he 
    had about the yellow army’s commander, followed by some patronizing advice to the seasoned General. The topics of 
    chemical warfare and anchovies were suspiciously avoided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
 The only other leader willing to comment on the developing 
    controversy was General Stevie the B, simply stating, “fucking pussies”. 
    The General also requested the press to remind its readers, “the B stands for Bossin”.</p>

<p className="story"><h3>The Many Colors of War</h3></p>
<p>Chaos and crimes of passion overshadowed any hope for actual strategy, as verbal conflict blended with 
senseless violence to fuel the cycle of incessant devastation.</p> 

...

<p className="story"><small>The soft echoes of peace were quickly silenced as Junior Lieutenant 
'the' Caso dropped his curry dinner, allegedly distracted by the sirenesque 
sounds of General Dowals’ mistress. Filled with shame and regret, the Lieutenant 
cracked a can of watery tuna and heeded the calls of war to fill the painful void. 
The 'drop heard round the world' proved unfortunate for the red army, who shared a border 
with the humiliated Lieutenant looking to unleash his anger on a nearest neighbor. A battle of 
passion broke out, resulting in a depleted red army with no option but to beg for an alliance with 
General Dowals in the north. Desperate for companionship in wartime, the General accepted the offer 
and the orange-red army marched to destroy any hopeless soldiers in its path. Unable to band together 
against the Goliath, the nations resorted to blame and slander as they fell pitifully to orange, all 
while a tuna-breathed Lieutenant continued to stir the pot of conflict from the grave. 
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps out of both breathe and energy, the yelling calmed in Africa as the nations all turned against Orange, 
leaving an opening for a win-starved Purple army to deploy a fresh strategy. The decision to not camp in a 
single country proved fruitful for Ol General Patch as he was able to build and bleed through the war-torn 
nations for a much needed Purple victory.
<br/>
<br/>
The battle turned to the grounds of the Roman Empire, where the generals, 
seemingly unable to learn from the past, began to repeat history (again). The 
coastal quarrels quickly boiled over, leaving room for the armies inland to grow and plot. 
With a valiant effort to break the infinite loops of the days of old, the Red army marched with 
hope and passion, only to fall by the limits of their own weaponry. With the privilege of superior 
funding, artillery, and technology, General CJ crushed the hope of the passionate Red army (and 
perhaps the world) allowing a blood-colored history to once again, repeat itself.</small></p>

<p>The Gordian knot of military bureaucracy just wasn’t worth fighting today. </p>

<p className="story">...
<br/>
<br/>
<small>Fed up with the constant ridicule from his peers, Jr. Lieutenant 'the' Caso reluctantly finished his mound of paperwork, 
anxious to finally order the ‘General the Caso’ nameplate to display prominently on his desk. <i>I’ll probably order the 
silver - to match the Live, Laugh, Love sign,</i> he pondered as he knocked on his superior’s door.
<br/>
“Come in,” the staunch old man ordered, clearly aggravated by the Jr. Lieutenant’s interruption and disheveled appearance. 
“Back again for the promotion plea I see?” The Jr. Lieutenant held back his loathe for the expendable old man. 
<br/>
“Yes, sir,” the Caso said. “I’ve got everything you asked for this time.” 
He handed the neatly stacked, laminated documents to the systemic man and pretended to respect the outdated procedures. 
“It’s all there, sir. May I have the title now?”
<br/>
“Not yet, Lieutenant,” the man sneered as he stood to face the Caso. 
“Put your goddamn crimes of passion to rest and secure a real win tonight. 
Then, if you’re lucky, I might consider your request, <i>Lieutenant</i>.” The Caso idly saluted and stomped back to his office to prepare a 
battle plan. He sighed as he noticed a new smudge on the <i>Junior Lieutenant</i> nameplate, sitting sluggishly on his desk.
<br/>
<br/>
Back out on the battlefield the soldiers were tired and the violence seemed infinite. Unknowingly fighting for nothing other than a broken man’s new nameplate, 
the Blue army obeyed their orders and listened to the Jr. Lieutenant’s passionately mediocre speech. “You only live once, so go fight for it!” concluded the 
sermon with a lackluster ‘hoo-rah’ as the army’s response. The soldiers knew not what they were fighting for, 
but nonetheless blindly adhered to the lines of command. “It is what it is,” a veteran soldier whispered to a questioning young recruit 
as they all watched the Jr. Lieutenant prepare the artillery for another inevitable battle.
<br/>
<br/>
The night began, once again, with bloodshed. Several battles immediately rang out across the nations, with frustrated generals 
continuing the attack orders amidst the truly random outcomes.  General Daddison, typically at the wrong end of the arbitrary 
results, held strong even as the nation’s leaders were conspiring against him. The conspiracy came to an abrupt halt as the 
Yellow army commander entered the conversation, and each nation worked to secure a strategic territory and make neighborly 
agreements - albeit only through necessity. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Caso, settling in the northwest, was sure this was the one. Repressing his desire to commit crimes of passion, the Jr. 
Lieutenant felt confident in his alliances and territory, with a vision of a shiny new nameplate gaining new clarity. 
General Johnson, a warrior for the greater good, noticed the rare discipline of the Junior Lieutenant and concluded this was too 
much power for the low-ranked leader. Johnson decided to break up the Blue army’s stronghold in return for nothing but a 
few empty ‘thank yous’ from the other world leaders. Meanwhile, a desperate Yellow army was eagerly waiting at 
the door to clean up the Blue/Green mess. General Daddison swept through the scraps of war, quickly gaining momentum on the 
coattails of the Green army’s good deeds. Having not seen endgame in quite some time, the Yellow commander made a miscalculated 
push. His scent of victory faded as quickly as it had emerged. A patiently waiting Red army marched westward for the final cleanup blow to the 
battle-ridden lands.
<br/>
<br/>
Jr. Lt. 'the' Caso was furious.</small>
</p>

    <h4>June 29, 2020</h4>
<small>
“That squirrelly Lieutenant is becoming my biggest regret. What are my options?” The old Blue superior 
was almost relieved by the news of his Junior Lieutenant’s sudden disappearance. 
<br/>
“Desertion carries a maximum punishment of dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all 
tokens, and confinement of up to five weeks, sir.” 
<br/>
“Fine, find him and lock him up.” 
<br/>
“Well sir, for desertion during a time of war, the ultimate punishment may be applied...”
<br/>
“Just find him. Check the rivers, we know he had some poopy pants to 
clean. And call the old virus, we have an open position.”
<br/>
<br/>

...
<br/>
<br/>

The news of Caso’s peace strike spread like wildfire and the generals were eager to take advantage 
of the chance at a legitimate win. The war moved to the grounds of the freedom-loving US of A, a 
land where irony and juxtaposition had gone long past the point of humility. A place where extreme 
individualism was posed to destroy a conceptual ideal perpetually doomed before the ink had even dried. 
<i> All’s fair in love and war.</i> 
<br/>
<br/>

As fate would have it, General Dowals was given the New England territory, formerly ruled by 
King Brady who had fled to the south, presumably to gather fresher oranges. General Dowals 
quickly stacked the few borders of the advantageous territory, a privilege the elitist coasties 
typically squander. Meanwhile, Ol General Patch was claiming sunny California and setting up camp 
in the west, with the virus and General “Switzerland” Johnson taking up the middle of the divided 
mess of a country. Without many options, the Red army made an attempt to seize the south, now 
sandwiched between Orange and Purple bicoastal strongholds. Forced to choose a side, the Red army 
pledged their allegiance to the east, figuring the hard-skinned Patriots would then march north to 
destroy the weak, lame-ass Swiss neutrality approach of the Green army. Focusing on westward expansion, the 
Red army declared war against an encroaching Purple army, making shallow claims against General 
Patch’s IT unit to stir the caldron of conflict. The contention ultimately proved disastrous for 
both nations, as a weakened Purple army spent its remaining 
troops crime of passioning the Red army, shouting, “how’s this math you fucking nerd”. 
<br/>
<br/>

Following the bloody battle in the west, tensions rose back east as General Dowals 
considered breaking his treaty with the war-torn Reds. Desperately pleading with the General 
to march north to prove to the world General Johnson’s bullshit foreign policy won’t hold any 
longer, the Red army commander lost the argument, consequently losing the battle. The Green 
army’s silence once again overshadowed the loud yells of bullshit, as the whiskey-fueled 
arguments and drama left the country thin and weak, leaving an opening for the silent puppet master to march to victory. 
<br/>
<br/>

The war moved north to Canada, but it seems the scribe’s notes were scrambled by the 
likes of a Canadian samsquantch, as no physical records of the battle were found. 
Rumors of a win by General Dowals have since surfaced, although the media cannot 
confirm or deny such claims without hard evidence. 
<br/>
<br/>

...
<br/>
<br/>

“Strategies are like underwear,” the old Blue superior told his new recruit following an acceptable first performance in blue. 
“Everyone has some, and they are all susceptible to being destroyed by a unruly heap of shit. 
We need to wipe the news clean of the disaster and illegitimate wins Lieutenant Caso caused for the boys in blue. 
A virus might just be the chaos we need to clear our record and go back to the days of old. Keep it up out there, 
General Serg. If you succeed, we may one day enjoy the privilege of invincibility the blue uniform once gave us. 
Stir the bullshit up, but do so under the radar. We don’t need another pants-shitter steering this ship.”
<br/>

“Yes, sir” the General replied.

Bombs blasting, earth shattered, flattering lights amongst smattered stars above scattering 
mortals huddled from the endless splatter. An armistice to take a stand against blood, death, 
yells, passion, and crime. Polarization pushes the pervasive poles of civilization creating a 
tyrannical tear through the ligaments of a society screaming, <b>‘freedom’</b>. Disagreement, ignorance, 
elitism and personal gain; the seeds of hideous flowers in the flourishing garden of war. Will the 
perennial ceasefire in remembrance of revolution prove to progress the power of peace any further? Or will it 
be mowed down by the detestation of individuals hypothetically hinged to create a hive of hate constructed 
seemingly for the purpose of the Hell of War. Only time, per usual, will yell.

“The virus and I have returned from the desert with an arrived agreement,” the Junior Lieutenant said, 
firmly holding a sawed off double-barreled shotgun directy at his superior’s dilapidated heart. 
“It would be in your best interest to sign this.” 
<br/>The superior officer showed no emotion, exhausted from the tumultuous months of his recent past. He took a quick glance at the contract held by General Serg and looked back toward the barrels of the gun. 
<br/>
“Over my dead, shitless-pantsed, body.”
<br/>
“Very well then, sir.”
<br/>
And with the simple motion of a contracting finger, blood was dispersed on a night of proposed peace, as a Junior Lieutenant instantaneously acquired newfound power.

<small>
Blood-soaked and traumatized from the gruesome event carried out by Lieutenant the Caso, General Serg grabbed a blue uniform from the dead superior’s closet and haphazardly parted ways with the Lieutenant. Refuge was offered at the Orange camp, a desirable escape for The Virus as General Dowals’ “don’t ask don’t tell” policy was well established amongst the below-the-radar types. Donning the purloined blue uniform, General Serg entered the Orange Gates under diplomatic immunity and prepared for what would be a long, bloody, emotionally draining evening of war.

<h3>Controversial Turn Miss Causes Big Loss for Orange</h3>
<h4>July 19, 2020</h4>
</p>
<p className="news">
The Orange base proved advantageous for General Serg at first, 
as evidence of a private comms channel between the generals recently surfaced. 
The evidence is spotty and contains several lewd transmissions, so the media 
will not be publishing a transcript at this time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Although the Yellow army fell short on truly random rolls once again, 
the remaining five nations battled for four hours and twenty minutes, 
marking it the longest, bloodiest, yellingist battle of the war to date. 
The battle can mostly be described as a stalemate, with each nation getting 
their own glimpse of victory, only to be squandered by the constant shifting of 
alliances by the others. The unexpected climax of the turmoil arrived following a 
controversial turn-miss by General Dowals. The “victim” claimed he was hacked by an enemy 
nation on a turn that, according to the General, was going to be an attempted victory march. 
The media is awaiting additional evidence as to whether this was a hack, a bug, or a logistical 
flaw in the Orange Army’s communications department. Either way, the controversy stirred up 
enough distraction for the Virus to spread, and eventually claim victory over a war-torn land.
<br/>
<br/>
Immediately following General Serg’s triumph, an intercepted transmission was 
acquired by an anonymous source associated with the press, and will be published as follows, unaltered:
<br/>
<br/>
TO: JR LT “T.” CASO<br/>
FROM: C. the V.<br/>
MEMO: INFILTRATED ORANGE BASE. BLUE VICTORY ESTABLISHED. <br/>
HACK SUCCESSFUL.<br/>
